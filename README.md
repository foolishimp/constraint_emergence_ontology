# Constraint-Emergence Ontology

A foundational framework proposing that reality, computation, and engineered systems share structural invariants: constraint networks produce stable patterns (Markov objects) whose boundaries, hierarchies, and dynamics recur across substrates.

## Documents

### [Constraint-Emergence Ontology](constraint_emergence_ontology.md)

The core philosophical work. Proposes that:

- Reality is fundamentally a self-organising constraint network
- Stable patterns (Markov objects) emerge in gaps between constraints
- Spacetime, particles, and gravity are emergent projections of constraint density
- The same architecture appears across physics, computation, biology, and engineered systems
- Mathematical descriptions are evolved cognitive tools, not the substrate they describe (Laws ≠ Physics)
- Meaning is a structural invariant: pattern matched against model, same operation at every scale

Engages with: Bohm, Deacon, Friston, Solms, Hawkins, Ladyman & Ross, Wolfram, Penrose, Einstein, Feynman, Deutsch, Smolin, Rovelli.

### [Emergent Reasoning in Large Language Models](emergent_reasoning.md)

A formal companion paper showing how LLMs instantiate the constraint-emergence architecture:

- Transformer computation as constrained topological traversal on a semantic manifold
- Attention as soft unification (continuous analogue of Prolog's discrete unification)
- Proto-symbolic attractor regions with Markov-blanket-like boundaries
- Hallucination as trajectory instability in weakly constrained regions
- Architectural implications for explicit, controllable reasoning

### [Ontology Templates](ontology_templates.md)

Logical Encapsulation — a meta-template for constraint specifications. Converts an LLM from a generative peer into a mechanical evaluator by explicitly constraining it to reason within defined axioms and procedures. A practical application of the ontology's core insight: constraints enable structured computation.

### [Political Ontology](political_ontology.md)

Political OS v1.0 — an LLM constraint specification for political analysis. Applies the framework's structural approach to political systems: analyse power, incentives, and constraints without importing ideology, narratives, or subjective values. Game-theoretic analysis within the constraint ontology.
