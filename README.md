# Constraint-Emergence Ontology

**A foundational framework proposing that reality, computation, and engineered systems share structural invariants**

---

## Introduction

This repository contains a philosophical ontology and its worked applications. The central thesis: reality is fundamentally a self-organising constraint network. Stable patterns — Markov objects — emerge in gaps between constraints, and their boundaries, hierarchies, and dynamics recur across substrates (physics, computation, biology, cognition, engineered systems).

The framework operates at the level of structure, not material:

> The invariants of reality live in the structure of admissible transformations, not in the material being transformed.

From this ontology, two practical contributions follow:

1. **Emergent Reasoning** — a formal model of LLM computation as constrained topological traversal on a semantic manifold, explaining how probabilistic systems produce structured inference.

2. **Logical Encapsulation** — a method for programming LLM reasoning by loading constraint specifications (axioms, invariants, evaluation algorithms) rather than detailed instructions. This converts an LLM from a generative peer into a mechanical evaluator.

The Political OS Suite is the primary worked example of Logical Encapsulation: four competing political philosophies expressed as formal constraint specifications, each producing mechanically divergent analyses of the same political phenomena.

## Documents

### Core Framework

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Constraint-Emergence Ontology](constraint_emergence_ontology.md) | The core philosophical work (v1.2). Constraint networks, Markov objects, emergent manifolds, observer theory, meaning as structural invariant. Engages with Bohm, Deacon, Friston, Wolfram, Penrose, Deutsch, and others. |
| [Emergent Reasoning](emergent_reasoning.md) | Formal companion paper. LLMs as constraint-manifold traversal systems: attention as soft unification, proto-symbolic attractors, hallucination as trajectory instability. Published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16592400). |
| [Ontology Templates](ontology_templates.md) | The Logical Encapsulation meta-template. How to build constraint specifications that program LLM reasoning within defined axioms and procedures. |

### Political OS Suite

Four political philosophies expressed as formal constraint specifications — worked examples of Logical Encapsulation using politics as the domain.

| Document | OS | Primary Unit | Nature |
|----------|----|-------------|--------|
| [Classical Liberal Political OS](classical_liberal_political_os.md) | Classical Liberal | Individual | Full governance system |
| [Marxist Political OS](marxist_political_os.md) | Marxist | Class | Diagnostic with governance gap |
| [Critical Justice Political OS](critical_justice_political_os.md) | Critical Justice | Intersectional identity group | Diagnostic program |
| [Theocratic Political OS](theocratic_political_os.md) | Theocratic | Divine order | Full governance system |

### Supporting Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [The Governance Stack](comparative_political_os_analysis.md) | Layered governance model (hardware → OS → runtime → program → bootstrap) and cross-OS structural analysis. Includes the completeness-as-discovery methodology. |
| [US Democratic Political OS](us_democratic_political_os.md) | The US Constitutional system mapped as an implementation of the Classical Liberal OS — where invariants are structurally protected and where they depend on corruptible programs. |
| [Political OS Test Suite](political_os_test_suite.md) | 15 test cases with predicted results across all four OS. Five evaluation methods for systematic validation. |

## How to Read This

### If you want to understand the ontology

1. Start with **[Constraint-Emergence Ontology](constraint_emergence_ontology.md)**. Read Part 0 (structural invariance) and Part I (the ontology itself — sections 1-18). Part II positions against existing thinkers; Part VIII maps to specific domains; Part IX is the research agenda.
2. Read **[Emergent Reasoning](emergent_reasoning.md)** for the formal treatment of how LLMs instantiate the constraint architecture.

### If you want to see the method in action

1. Read **[Ontology Templates](ontology_templates.md)** to understand Logical Encapsulation — the technique of programming LLM reasoning through constraint specifications.
2. Load **[Classical Liberal Political OS](classical_liberal_political_os.md)** into a fresh LLM session. Ask it to evaluate a political phenomenon. Observe how constraints shape the output.
3. Load a different OS (e.g., [Marxist](marxist_political_os.md)) in a new session with the same question. Compare the mechanically divergent results.

### If you want to run the test suite

1. Read the **[Political OS Test Suite](political_os_test_suite.md)** for instructions and test cases.
2. Each LLM session gets **exactly one OS document** — never load two OS documents in the same session.
3. Follow Method 1 (single case) to familiarize yourself, then Method 2 (full suite) for systematic validation.
4. The predicted results matrix lets you verify whether the LLM is reasoning within constraints or drifting to its training priors.

### If you want to understand the comparative analysis

1. Read the four OS documents first (or at least the Classical Liberal and one other).
2. Read **[The Governance Stack](comparative_political_os_analysis.md)** — the layered model from hardware (planet) through OS, runtime, program, and bootstrap.
3. The comparative analysis discovers which candidates are full operating systems and which are fragments (diagnostic programs, lenses). This is an analytical outcome, not an assumption.
