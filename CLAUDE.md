# CLAUDE.md - Constraint-Emergence Ontology

## Project Overview

This repository contains philosophical ontology work by Dimitar Popov exploring structural invariants across reality, computation, and engineered systems.

- **[emergent_reasoning](https://github.com/foolishimp/emergent_reasoning)** - Formal companion (separate repo): LLMs as constraint-manifold traversal systems
- **ontology_templates.md** - Logical Encapsulation meta-template for LLM constraint specs
- **political_os/** - Political OS Suite subdirectory containing:
  - Four OS constraint specifications (Classical Liberal, Marxist, Critical Justice, Theocratic)
  - Comparative analysis (The Governance Stack), US Democratic OS implementation, test suite
  - reports/ - Real-world invariant analyses

## Core Framework (constraint_emergence_ontology.md)

### Structure
- **Part 0**: Structural invariance, universal computation, ontology of change, generative principle
- **Part I (Sections 1-18)**: The ontology — constraint networks, Markov objects, emergent manifolds, observer theory, meaning
- **Part II**: Philosophical positioning — relationships to Einstein, Bohm, Feynman, Wolfram, Penrose, Deutsch, Deacon, Smolin
- **Part V**: Bridge to AI SDLC — information-driven construction, abiogenesis insight
- **Part VIII**: Domain mappings — physics, software engineering (AI SDLC), LLMs
- **Part VIII-D**: The Constraint Functor — formal category-theoretic bridge between physical and computational Markov objects
- **Part IX**: Research agenda and falsifiability
- **Appendix**: Formal summary of emergent reasoning in LLMs

### Key Concepts
- **Constraint network**: Fundamental substrate — reality as self-organising constraints
- **Generative principle**: As soon as a stable configuration is possible within a constraint structure, it will emerge
- **Markov objects**: Stable patterns with constraint-defined boundaries (IS Friston's Markov blanket in substrate-neutral vocabulary)
- **Emergent manifolds**: Hierarchical layers with their own effective laws
- **Laws != Physics**: Mathematical descriptions are evolved cognitive tools, not the substrate
- **Meaning as invariant**: Pattern matched against model — same operation at every scale
- **Evaluator-as-prompter**: brainstem->cortex, human->LLM, specification->builder — same architecture
- **Information-driven construction**: Encoded representation → constructor → constructed structure (universal pattern)
- **Abiogenesis insight**: Constructor precedes specification; encoding emerges as solution to reliable replication
- **Unit of change**: Discrete, fundamental; "time" is emergent measure of change on constraint surfaces
- **Hallucination as degeneracy**: Probability landscape degenerate — multiple paths equivalent; label belongs to observer

### Terminology
- "Platonic" / "Aristotelian" = shorthand for two poles of a perennial tension (ideas ARE reality vs ideas DESCRIBE reality), not strict historical attribution
- Status markers in related docs: [COMPLETE], [PARTIAL], [NOT STARTED], [PLANNED]

### Influences (honestly traced)
- **Bohm** - deepest influence (implicate/explicate order)
- **Deacon** - absential causation, emergence through constraint
- **Solms** - consciousness, affect as primary; gateway to Friston
- **Friston** - Markov blankets (via Solms)
- **Ladyman & Ross** - scale-relative ontology, time (via Every Thing Must Go)
- **Hawkins** - cortical columns, distributed model-building
- **Wolfram** - computational emergence (structural parallel, philosophical divergence)
- **Penrose** - twistor theory (alignment), non-computability (divergence)
- **Deutsch** - constructor theory (structural parallel, Platonic divergence)

## Working Method

This document is developed through adversarial review — channeling specific thinkers as critics and incorporating or responding to their objections. The author's rule: **only add material that is not derivable from the existing text**. If a reader can construct the argument from what's already there, it doesn't need to be added.
