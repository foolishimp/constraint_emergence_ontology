title: "Constraint-Emergence Ontology"
abstract: >-
  A foundational framework proposing that reality, computation, and
  engineered systems share structural invariants: constraint networks
  produce stable patterns (Markov objects) whose boundaries, hierarchies,
  and dynamics recur across substrates. Includes formal companion work on
  emergent reasoning in LLMs, a method for programming LLM reasoning via
  constraint specifications, and a political philosophy suite demonstrating
  the method across four ideological frameworks with six real-world analyses.
